# Gesture Pose to Emoji

This week we learned how to train a model. I followed the process to collect data and training a model on google colab. I trained on punch and flex gestures and finally send the classified result to p5 and display the emoji based on the results.

Training and collecting data process is easy. I was wondering if there exist better nerual network structers to classify gestures. The one used for this example is very simple nerual network.
